# Python
Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name iS Elias A. Jinko from The Netherland. I have been learning python from beginners, intermediate python, intermediate, advance and professional portfolio building independent assignment level. I want to master everything about python.
I had a salesforce admin certificate but realised if I want to make meaningful changes in my IT life then python will be the best option. I am looking for help from all walks of life. I have an idea of an application to build shortly after I master python. Today is 12-March-2021, God Willing, 5 months from now I should not only finish python but master the bolt and nuts of it and start applying to build my dream application. I will need any support from experienced developers .you can reach me
