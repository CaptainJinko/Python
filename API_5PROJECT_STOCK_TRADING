#So we're actually only interested in the values. So we can put that in here
so that each item in this new list is composed of only the values and not the
keys.we're going to need to do a bit of a list comprehension. create a variable data_list = [new item for in list ]

#To-do number three involves finding the positive difference between step one and two,
#so yesterday's closing price and the day before yesterday's closing price.Now the hint takes us to the Python abs function,
#It's a function that returns the absolute value of a number.So it basically just gets rid of any negative sign in front of a number.
#code below

difference=abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#The difference is going to be yesterday's closing price subtract by the day before yesterday's closing price. Now,
#because these two are strings, if we actually run the code right now,you're going to get an error.
#so we can quite easily convert them into a floating point numbers just by wrapping the float function around them. If we print that out,

#you have to make sure that any capitalization or spelling must match their requirements exactly.
#Now we're going to get hold of our response and I'm going to print out the response as a JSON.

    print(three_articles)

#Then our start is probably going to be from the beginning and then we're going to loop to stop minus one.So that's going to be :3 because let's start counting from zero. Likethat. 
#And now if I print these three articles,right,to see them,if you click on this soft wrap and you can see the three items,one, two, and three.
